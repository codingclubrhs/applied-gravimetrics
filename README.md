Welcome to Applied Gravimetrics version 1.0! 
This is a program that strives to simulate gravity as accurately as possible.

The program is pretty simple from a client side. 
There are four tabs in the UI that can be selected to do various things:
+ The build tab allows the user to create planets. Edit the planet's properties in the menu then left click to place the planet.
+ The edit tab allows the user to, you guessed it, edit existing planets. Click on or near a planet to select it and then change its properties in the menu.
+ The delete tab deletes planets. Click on a planet to delete it. There's really not much to be said here.
+ The settings tab gives access to controls that change the underlying rules of the program. Right now you can use it to change the rate at which time passes, affect the way that planets behave when they move off the screen (whether they wrap around, are destroyed, or act as normal), and change the size of the screen. It's important to note that changing the rate at which time passes will affect how accurate the program is. The slower, the more accurate.
+ In addition, the simulation can be paused and resumed either by clicking the pause button in the corner of the screen or by pressing space.

Right now the program is in a semi-completed state, and is no longer in active development. Updates might come at a later date.
